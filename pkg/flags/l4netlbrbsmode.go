// L4 External LoadBalancer feature enable flag
// Possible values:
// * opt-in - Controller only manages Net LBs for services that contain opt-in annotation: cloud.google.com/l4-rbs: '{"enabled":true}' or
//            finalizer key gke.networking.io/l4-netlb-v2.
//             If managed service is already created as target pool based then it is migrated to regional-backend service based load balancer.
// * enabled - Controller manages all new Net LBs and all Net LBs for services with gke.networking.io/l4-netlb-v2 finalizer.
//             If managed service is already created as target pool based then it is migrated to regional-backend service based load balancer.
// * enforced - Controller manages all new Net LBs and all Net LBs for services with gke.networking.io/l4-netlb-v2 finalizer.
//              Services created as target pool based load balancer are migrated regardless of the annotation.
// * rollback - Controller rolls back changes to services and some GCP resources triggering the service-controller to start managing the services in the legacy way.
